# Java Practice Projects

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my Java practice projects and coding exercises. Here you'll find a variety of small applications, algorithms, and solutions designed to help me (and others) strengthen Java programming skills.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- Coding challenges and algorithm solutions
- Mini-projects and console applications
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) practice
- Code snippets and useful Java patterns

## 📚 Why This Repo?

As a Computer Science student at York University, I use this space to:
- Practice and reinforce Java concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews (LeetCode, NeetCode, etc.)
- Document my learning journey and share knowledge with others

## 🛠️ How to Use

Feel free to browse, clone, or fork any of the projects here. Each folder contains a separate project or set of exercises, usually with a `README.md` explaining what it does and how to run it.

## 🙌 Contributions

If you have suggestions, feedback, or want to add your own Java exercises, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
